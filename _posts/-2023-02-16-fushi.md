Hello teachers, I am glad to meet you.My name is YGX, 23 years old, from Henan XinXiang, graduated from Henan normal university in last year.

I am serious and hard-working person. Faced with problems, I will use agile thinking to find solutions, face difficulites and face challenges. In addition, the work and study in university gave me a good sense of teamwork and innovation.

There are two reasons why I chose to apply for the CS major of Inner Mongolian University. One is that I want to study NLP at here. The other is that I think I will have fully study life in here, I believe.

The above is my self-introduction. I appreciate to teachers for listening. I hope that I can become a student of Inner Mongolian University in the near future. Thanks.
